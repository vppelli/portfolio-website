                <h3>CLIENT SIDE</h3>
                <p>
                    First I need to set up a development environment to work with, React Native and Expo was used.
                    Designing the apps UI '& Accessibility functionality with Native UI components and chat features
                    from the Gifted Chat library. Once the layout was established I needed to connect the backend to the
                    app so users could sign-in and message.<br>
                    What if you lost your internet connection and needed to view an old message sent?<br>
                    Phase 4 added the feature to have messages stored locally using async Storage. This allowed users to
                    view older messages, once online you could send messages and receive updated messages.<br>
                    All that was left was to provide users with the ability to send Images, take photos, and send their
                    location.
                </p>
                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <p>
                    When looking back integrating the chat bot was the most challenging and fun experiences. Since this
                    was the first time I added a extra feature that was not in the main objective. Finding ways to get
                    it to work with gifted chat, learning about hiding secret keys through environment variables. I had
                    to really search though multiple documentations, took lots of trial and error but in the end I
                    learned so much from it.
