                        you
                        can talk with a chat-bot! Simple and understandable, using Gifted Chat to help design and setup
                        the
                        UI component, it will feel natural to use.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
                    <p>
                        To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a
                        chat
                        interface and options to share images and their location.<br>
                        Extra: Integrate a chat bot to help respond
                        to users questions about chat app.

                    <h2>APPROACH</h2>
                    <h3>FIREBASE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Firebase provided by Google helps host databases, services, authentication, and integration for
                        a variety of applications.<br>
                        This was a perfect for the Chat app. Using there authentication users can anonymously sign-in
                        with Firebase.<br>
                        With Firebase: Firestore helps store conversations, photos and videos to their database. Very
                        helpful when need to read a old message sent by a friend or self.
                    </p>
                    <h3>DIALOGFLOW</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dialogflow provided by Google is a natural language understanding platform used to design and
                        integrate a conversational user interface into mobile apps.<br>
                        With Dialogflow integrated into the Chat App, I was able to design a bot to respond to questions
                        asked by users. From App related questions to very basic conversations ( eg. Hello, Can I ask
                        you a question, What is Chat App, )
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="m-t-3">CLIENT SIDE</h3>
                    <p>
                        First I need to set up a development environment to work with, React Native and Expo was used.
                        Designing the apps UI '& Accessibility functionality with Native UI components and chat features
                        from the Gifted Chat library. Once the layout was established I needed to connect the backend to
                        the
                        app so users could sign-in and message.<br>
                        What if you lost your internet connection and needed to view an old message sent?<br>
                        Phase 4 added the feature to have messages stored locally using async Storage. This allowed
                        users to
                        view older messages, once online you could send messages and receive updated messages.<br>
                        All that was left was to provide users with the ability to send Images, take photos, and send
                        their
                        location.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box m-t-3">
                <div class="flex-column-2" style="justify-content: start;">
                    <div class="img-box m-b-2" style="background-image: url('./img/chat-app-bg.gif');"></div>
                    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                    <p>
                        When looking back integrating the chat bot was the most challenging and fun experiences. Since
                        this
                        was the first time I added a extra feature that was not in the main objective. Finding ways to
                        get
                        it to work with gifted chat, learning about hiding secret keys through environment variables. I
                        had
                        to really search though multiple documentations, took lots of trial and error but in the end I
                        learned so much from it.
